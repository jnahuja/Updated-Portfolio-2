      <p class="textContent">My name is Jashan, and I'm a hermit and a web developer. I like cake, specifically chocolate cake with Vanilla icing. I drive a Lambo, or rather, a Honda. Sometimes I watch movies. Life's not bad. Here are some of my favorite things. The color purple. The dew on a blade of grass. The number 12. Running really fast after a ball. Linguistic elasticity.</p>

      <p class="textContent">To set the record straight, my favorite season is Summer, followed by Autumn. I am an outdoorsman, and have taught canoeing to many a young person. If I could play any instrument it would be Taiko drumming, which is a Japanese art form, in which a group of people plays very large drums in meticulous synchronisity. I have a lovely wife, called Katrina. And after all of that, I would like to state, for the record, that I am happy to be studying web-development so that I can share my story with you!</p>
